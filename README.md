# 1Ô∏è‚É£üêùüèéÔ∏è The One Billion Row Challenge in C
I wanted to provide some benchmarks with C code and challenge implementations in other languages.

## Generating raw data

```
git clone https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc
cd 1brc
./mvnw clean verify
./create_measurements.sh 100000000
```
You may need to install jdk 21.

## Running the challenge

```
make
```
Or run it manually:
```
gcc -O3 -o summarize 1brc.c -lpthread
time ./summarize 1brc/measurements.txt $(nrpoc)
```

## Results
I was limited by the resources of my laptop which is Intel 4-core i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz/ with 6G RAM. So I can only test with 100 million rows.
The first version of my code includes already some basic optimizations and gives
an execution time of 3.6s. I did further optimizations with multi-threads,
on hashing and parsing. The final version gives an execution time of 0.4s.

For comparaison, I ran the top 3 java best-performers and another C implementation as well.

For anyone who are interested in running the code with 1 billion rows, please let me know.
